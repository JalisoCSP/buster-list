# Usage

Hey Jason, I've made this with a standard rails new, but it does have some extra
stuff that is definitely not required.

1. Clone this repo locally. `git clone git@github.com:JalisoCSP/buster-list.git`

2. `yarn install --check-files`

3. `bundle install`

4. `rails db:create db:migrate`

5. `rails s`

6. Navigate to localhost:3000 (default)

The code you likely want to look at is in the commit: 36053bb
